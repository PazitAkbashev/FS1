                <h4>2024 Porsche 911 GT3 / GT3 RS</h4>
                <p>Sports-car specialist Porsche has been crafting impossibly delicious 911 models for decades, but the
                    2024
                    911 GT3 and GT3 RS models are its most uncompromised and outrageously quick versions to date. These
                    track-day champs are powered by a naturally aspirated 4.0-liter six-cylinder engine that howls to a
                    9000
                    rpm redline. In GT3 guise, the flat-six makes 502 horsepower, but go for the GT3 RS or S/T and it
                    gets
                    juiced to 518 ponies. Parked next to a standard 911, the GT3 models look like entirely different
                    cars,
                    especially the RS, which wears wild aero elements including a giant rear wing. They look like they
                    belong on a race track because they do. The regular 911 is no slouch when it comes to driving
                    enjoyment,
                    but the GT3 models are sharper, quicker, and more intense in every possible way—and you'll find them
                    both on our 2024 Editors' Choice list. But that's not to say they're too unrefined for road use.
                    Quite
                    the opposite, especially for the Touring model, which makes this ultimate 911 a car that you can
                    comfortably drive to Whole Foods or take on a road trip. We can't imagine a cooler way to travel.

                <h4>2025 Porsche 718 EV</h4>
                <p>Porsche is transforming its current lineup of luxury SUVs and sports cars into a veritable stampede
                    of
                    electrified steeds. Before the gas-powered 718 Cayman and 718 Boxster bid farewell, Porsche plans to
                    debut an all-electric 718 EV that's rumored to be available in both hardtop and convertible
                    variants.
                    Few details are available beyond confirmation of its existence, but Porsche did say the electric 718
                    will ride on a newly developed sports-car platform that works to keep the vehicle as light as
                    possible.
                    Expect a rear-motor-only version to serve as the entry-level 718 EV, while an all-electric GTS
                    equivalent will likely use all-wheel drive to provide additional grip and even brisker acceleration.
                    The
                    718 EV should have at least 250 miles of driving range, and will likely use a similar 800-volt
                    architecture that allows the large Taycan to DC fast-charge at a rate of up to 270 kWh. We'll update
                    this space as specs become available; we expect the 718 EV to launch sometime in 2025.

                <h4>2024 Porsche 911 Turbo</h4>
                <p>To the untrained eye, the Porsche 911 Turbo and Turbo S don’t look that special, sporting the same
                    curvaceous styling as every other Porsche coupe to bear those iconic three digits. But packed into
                    the
                    tail end of the Turbo and Turbo S models is a potent twin-turbo 3.7-liter flat-six, pumping out 572
                    horsepower in the former and a whopping 640 ponies in the latter variant. That punchy powertrain saw
                    the
                    Turbo S become one of the quickest cars we’ve ever tested, ripping to 60 mph from a standstill in a
                    mere
                    2.2 seconds and covering a quarter mile in just 9.9 seconds at 138 mph. But the Turbo models aren’t
                    just
                    about straight-line speed—poised handling, a communicative steering wheel, and grippy tires mean the
                    911
                    Turbo is just as adept at blasting down a curvy road as it is launching to ludicrous speeds. While
                    we
                    wish there was an option for a manual transmission, the seemingly clairvoyant eight-speed automatic
                    shifts far quicker than our feet and hands could ever accomplish. Among the field of flashy supercar
                    competition, the 911 Turbo and Turbo S maintain a low profile while still providing mind-bending
                    performance and, of course, the prestigious Porsche badge, making them a great addition to our 2024
                    Editors' Choice list.
