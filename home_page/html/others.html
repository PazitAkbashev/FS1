                <h4>2024 Toyota GR Supra</h4>
                <p>While most of Toyota's lineup consists of consumer-grade sedans and SUVs, models marked with the
                    initials GR represent the automaker's highest levels of performance, and chief among that subset is
                    the 2024 GR Supra. While it's based on—and built alongside—the BMW Z4 convertible, the Supra brings
                    an entirely different curb appeal that helped land it on our 2024 Editors' Choice list. The two
                    share most everything else though, including 255-hp turbocharged four-cylinder and 382-hp
                    turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder engines. All Supra models are rear-wheel drive and you can have
                    either an eight-speed automatic or, as we prefer, a six-speed manual. The interior borrows heavily
                    from the BMW parts bin—either a good or bad thing depending on who you ask. But it comes with few
                    compromises and there's plenty of space for two adults to get comfortable even on long drives. The
                    Supra's sharp handling and responsive powertrains, however, mean its happier nipping apexes than
                    long highway slogs. </p>

                <h4>2025 BMW Z4</h4>
                <p>All sports cars come with a fun-loving attitude standard but the 2025 BMW Z4 goes a step further with
                    a soft-top layout that lets you bask in the sun while you zip down the roads that you drive for
                    pleasure. The little roadster isn't as focused on the ability to devour twisty tarmac as rivals such
                    as the Porsche 718 Boxster or the Toyota Supra—the latter of which shares the Z4's BMW-based
                    mechanicals. But the Z4 is nonetheless plenty lively, and it moves along eagerly with either of its
                    engine options. A 255-hp turbocharged four-cylinder is standard, as is an eight-speed automatic
                    transmission and rear-wheel drive. For those wanting maximum power, there's a ferocious 382-hp
                    turbocharged inline-six which can, for the first time, be optioned with a new six-speed manual
                    transmission that adds an extra dimension of driver involvement. Inside, you'll find a premium cabin
                    with high-quality materials, a 10.3-inch infotainment display, and plenty of space for two adults.
                    What you might not expect from a car this size is practicality but the Z4 offers a relatively large
                    trunk for a small roadster; it swallowed three carry-on suitcases in our testing. All the better for
                    justifying this stylish, convertible sports car as your daily driver.</p>

                <h4>2024 Lotus Emira</h4>
                <p>The 2024 Lotus Emira is the latest model from the legendary British sports car maker and the last to
                    use an internal combustion engine. That's right. Lotus is preparing for an all-electric future, as
                    previewed by the Evija hypercar. But before bidding adieu to its gasoline-fueled traditions, the
                    company will treat purists to one final gas-burning model. As the successor to the Evora GT, which
                    is currently the only Lotus sold in the U.S., the Emira is more practical, has a far nicer interior,
                    and offers active safety equipment for the first time. While the Emira i4 will eventually have a
                    standard turbo four with 360 horsepower, Lotus is only selling the version with a supercharged V-6
                    pumping out 400 ponies right now. This sports car also comes with a six-speed manual gearbox and its
                    performance is up there with Porsche's 718 Cayman.</p>
