                <h4>Chevrolet Corvette</h4>
                <p>We've been singing the praises of the C8-generation Chevrolet Corvette since it launched because it
                    brings mid-engine supercar performance to the affordable end of the sports-car spectrum. It costs
                    half as much as more exotic rivals, but in no way are you getting only half the thrills. A naturally
                    aspirated V-8 engine thunders just behind your skull, providing the auditory chills of an exotic
                    sports car. The Vette's handling is razor-sharp and endlessly rewarding on a twisty back road. Track
                    days are a joy, with confidence-raising handling and massive amounts of power on tap that make
                    blasting out of corners a hoot. When it comes to commuting and road-tripping, the Corvette
                    transforms into a comfortable cruiser with a near-luxury cabin, an agreeable ride, and a surprising
                    amount of cargo capacity. Its dual-purpose personality has earned it 10Best and Editor's Choice
                    awards again for 2024. Both a coupe and a convertible model are offered, but even the coupe comes
                    with a lift-off targa top so you always have the option of basking in the sun and feeling the wind
                    in your locks. What more could you ask for? Well, for those who do want to turn things up to the
                    max, there's always the killer Corvette Z06 (reviewed separately), which does just that.

                <h4>2024 Chevrolet Corvette E-Ray</h4>
                <p>While it competes with thoroughbred sports cars from Ferrari, Lamborghini, and Porsche, the 2024
                    Chevrolet Corvette E-Ray is as American as American football, cowboys, and jazz. The C8-generation
                    Vette debuted in 2020 with a mid-engine layout and the exotic-car proportions that go with it, and
                    now this new E-Ray incorporates a hybrid powertrain that pushes performance further with electrons.
                    An electric motor powers the front wheels while the C8's standard 6.2-liter pushrod V-8 is on duty
                    out back. Together they develop 655 combined horsepower, which means the all-wheel drive Corvette
                    E-Ray is within 15 horsepower of the range-topping Z06. In addition to that, the E-Ray features a
                    stealth driving mode that lets you sneak in and out of your neighborhood on silent electric power
                    without waking the neighbors. Since its launch, the C8 Corvette has been a staff favorite at the Car
                    and Driver offices and a 10Best winner, not only because of its brilliant ride-and-handling and
                    seemingly endless power but also because of how easy it is to live with daily. The E-Ray joins the
                    standard car on our 10Best and Editors' Choice lists for 2024. Sure, there are only two seats, but
                    with cargo space behind the engine and under the front hood, it's practical as well as hellaciously
                    thrilling.</p>

                <h4>Chevrolet Corvette ZR1</h4>
                <p>Chevrolet's legendary sports car is about to get even fiercer. The 670-horsepower Corvette Z06
                    —motivated by a naturally aspirated 5.5-liter V-8 engine—will be upstaged by a new ZR1 in 2025. The
                    ZR1 will build upon the excellent Z06, cranking power output to new heights and elevating the
                    American icon to compete with Ferraris and Lamborghinis. The prodigious performance will likely come
                    with equally wild styling, sporting race-car-inspired aerodynamics that should help the Corvette
                    improve even further upon the Z06's absurdly quick Lightning Lap times. We also expect an even more
                    powerful hybridized model to arrive in 2026, with an electric motor pushing the Corvette toward the
                    1000 horsepower mark.</p>
