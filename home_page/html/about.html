            <h1>An Introduction to Car and Driver</h1>
            <p>Welcome to Car and Driver. We've created this page to introduce
                ourselves to you and to let you know what it is we do around here.
            </p>

            <p>
                Car and Driver is a print and digital magazine covering the
                newest car offerings, showcasing car culture, and helping
                people shopping for a car by serving up our unique brand of
                intelligence, independence, and irreverence. We've been in the
                magazine business since 1955 and online for more than two decades.

                We make the complicated easier to understand for those of you shopping
                for a new car and push the limits of performance machines for our
                enthusiast readers. A Car and Driver review balances the subjective
                with objective data and pulls no punches; on our best days, we hope we
                even give you a good laugh. We pull together multi-car comparison
                tests that separate the good, the bad, and the ugly to give you the
                product knowledge that you crave. Our online ranking system breaks down
                vehicle segments to help shoppers make informed decisions. In addition
                to sharp and unbiased reviews, our features and columns allow our readers
                to ride shotgun with the world's finest automotive writers.

            <h1>Vehicle Testing</h1>
            <p>We're also in the business of testing cars, trucks, SUVs, and vans. That's what separates us from other
                automotive media. For more than 60 years we've been answering the objective questions—How fast? How
                quick? How much grip?—and our findings have settled countless barroom bets. With the goal of covering
                every make and model on the market, we test upward of 400 vehicles per year, more than anyone else in
                the industry. In the early days of the magazine, just as the interstate highway system began to connect
                the country, we used a stopwatch to measure acceleration times. Today, we use highly precise GPS-based
                testing equipment. Testing is continually evolving as technology and vehicles change. Recently we've
                added several static tests to measure cargo space, interior stowage pockets, infotainment response time,
                and the size of blind spots, among other things. In all, we collect more than 200 data points on every
                test vehicle.

                Why put so much energy into vehicle testing? We believe that third-party testing is critical because
                manufacturers' performance claims are just that: claims. Over the years, C/D testing has uncovered
                numerous cars that didn't perform as promised. In 1999, our test of an underperforming Ford Mustang
                Cobra led Ford to admit that defective intake manifolds were compromising airflow. Ford installed new
                intake manifolds and mufflers to deliver the promised horses. When a 2001 Mazda Miata proved slower than
                the outgoing model despite a claimed 15-horsepower increase, we called BS. Mazda then confessed that the
                155-horsepower number came from a Japanese version that didn't pass U.S. emission standards. Mazda
                offered to buy back early models or provide free maintenance and $500. More recently, Toyota claimed
                that the 2020 Supra's center of gravity was lower than the GR86's, so we measured that. Toyota was
                wrong.
